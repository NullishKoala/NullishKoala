- 🦄 I've got 7 years experience in gamedev working for an indie video games studio as an executive assistant to the board of directors.

- 🌱 I’m now learning React! Recently gratuated with distinction from [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/cfgdegree/) Fullstack degree. You can check my final project [here](https://github.com/carolinenorris1/cfg_project). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving pets, wellbeing, sports, travelling and anything making life easier and more sustainable.
- 🚀My aim is to create apps that would help people, my brain is constatnly giving me ideas. Now, I just need to learn how to develop all that! 🤓
